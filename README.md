## 📖 Description
**NilWare AimPro V2.0** is a high-performance, 0% UNC, universal **Aimbot** and **ESP** solution for Roblox.
It features a unique **Friendly Group Selector**, allowing you to set up custom alliances between teams (e.g., *Maintenance* + *Security* = Friends) regardless of the game's default team logic.

### 🌟 Key Features
*   **Universal Aimbot:** Works on standard R6/R15 characters.
*   **Smart ESP:** Distance-based rendering with health bars and tracers.
*   **Friendly Groups:** Custom exclusions from Aimbot based on team alliances.
*   **Auto-Save:** Your group configurations are saved automatically per game.

## ⚙️ Performance & Optimization
We prioritize your FPS. The ESP system uses a smart culling logic:

*   🟢 **Teammate Render Distance:** `100 studs`
    *   *Reason:* Preventing FPS drops in crowded bases. You don't need to see your friends across the map.
*   🔴 **Enemy Render Distance:** `2000 studs`
    *   *Reason:* Maximum tactical advantage. See hostiles before they see you.

> *Note: These values are optimized for high-population servers (Tested on Naramo).*
